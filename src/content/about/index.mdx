bio: >-
  I’m Jonathan Harrell, a designer and front-end engineer. I’ve been developing websites and applications for the last six years for a wide range of clients, from SaaS startups to established software companies to global hedge funds. While I now develop full-time, I am also passionate about design, and have worked as a UI/UX designer in an agency context. I love sharing what I know on this blog and others. I am currently based in Brooklyn, New York.

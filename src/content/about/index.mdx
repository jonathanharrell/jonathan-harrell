bio: >-
  I’m Jonathan Harrell, a designer and front-end engineer. I’ve been developing
  websites and applications for the last six years for a wide range of clients,
  from SaaS startups to established software companies to global hedge funds.
  While I am now a full-time software engineer, I am also passionate about
  design, and have worked as a UI/UX designer in an agency context. I am
  currently based in Brooklyn, New York.

        I maintain a very lightweight CSS library that provides foundational

        typography and input styling.

HTML form inputs have always been notoriously difficult to style with CSS, but there are several little-used selectors that give us significant power to style inputs and surrounding elements. Some of these are relatively new, while others have been available for quite some time.

<Codepen id="vVEexG"/>

## :placeholder-shown

![A common UX pattern involves showing a placeholder within an input and then moving that placeholder text above the input when a user starts typing.](/img/placeholder-shown.svg)

The first selector is relatively new and doesn’t have complete [browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-placeholder-shown) yet. However, this seems like something that could easily work as a progressive enhancement. The selector allows us to detect whether a placeholder is currently visible to the user. This could come in handy if we want to dynamically hide and show the input’s associated label.

Here I am hiding the label until the user types in the input, thus hiding the placeholder. I use a nice transition effect to display the label. Note that for this to work, the label must come AFTER the input.

```html
<div class="form-group">
  <input type="text" id="dynamic-label-input" placeholder="Enter some text">
  <label for="dynamic-label-input">Enter some text</label>
</div>
```

```css
.form-group {
  position: relative;
  padding-top: 1.5rem;
}

label {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  font-size: var(--font-size-small);
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition: all 0.2s ease-out;
}

input:placeholder-shown + label {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(1rem);
}
```

## :required

![Required inputs can be styled to show a required message, alerting the user that these inputs must be filled in.](/img/required.svg)

Use this selector to indicate that an input has the `required` attribute. Here I am using an empty `.help-text` span and placing some content dynamically using the `::before` pseudo-element. Realistically, this would be done with JavaScript, but I am including here to demonstrate a pure CSS approach.

```html
<label for="required-input">Required input</label>
<input type="text" id="required-input" required>
<span class="help-text"></span>
```

```css
input:required + .help-text::before {
  content: '*Required';
}
```

## :optional

![Optional inputs can be styled to show an optional message, alerting the user that these inputs aren't required.](/img/optional.svg)

This selector does the opposite of `:required`. I am again using an empty `.help-text` `span` to display some optional text if the required attribute is NOT present.

```css
input:optional + .help-text::before {
  content: '*Optional';
}
```

## :disabled

![Disabled inputs can be styled to appear dimmer than enabled inputs, letting the user know that these inputs cannot be interacted with.](/img/disabled.svg)

This one should be familiar to most of you, but still important to remember. It’s pretty essential to display whether or not an input is disabled to a user.

```css
&:disabled {
  border-color: var(--gray-lighter);
  background-color: var(--gray-lightest);
  color: var(--gray-light);
}
```

## :read-only

![Read-only inputs can be styled with their values dimmer than writable inputs, letting the user know that the values of these inputs cannot be altered.](/img/read-only.svg)

An input with the `readonly` attribute should convey a slightly different meaning than a disabled input. Thankfully we have this selector to help with that.

```html
<input type="text" value="Read-only value" readonly>
```

```css
input:read-only {
  border-color: var(--gray-lighter);
  color: var(--gray);
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
```

## :valid

![Valid inputs can be styled with a success state, such as a check box, letting users know when these inputs have been successfully filled in.](/img/valid.svg)

While much form validation will happen with JavaScript, we are able to take advantage of HTML form validation and style inputs accordingly. This selector gives us the chance to style any input which is currently passing the native browser validation rules.

Here I am encoding an svg to display a checkbox in the input using the `background-image` property.

```css
input:valid {
  border-color: var(--color-primary);
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...");
}
```

## :invalid

![Invalid inputs can be styled with a warning or error message, letting users know when these inputs are not passing their validation rules.](/img/invalid.svg)

This selector checks if an input is currently NOT passing the native browser validation rules (for example, if an email input does not contain a real email).

Again, I am encoding an svg to display a ‘x’ in the input.

```css
input:invalid {
  border-color: var(--color-error);
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...");
}
```

I can also customize some validation messages for each input type using the `.help-text` span and the `::before` pseudo-element.

```html
<label for="invalid-email">Invalid input</label>
<input type="email" id="invalid-email" value="notanemail">
<span class="help-text"></span>
```

```css
input[type='email']:invalid + .help-text::before {
  content: 'You must enter a valid email.'
}
```

## :in-range/:out-of-range

![Inputs with range attributes defined can be styled when they are in or out-of-range, letting users know if the inputs are or are not passing their validation rules.](/img/out-of-range.svg)

These selectors detect whether the value of a number input is within the min/max values specified or not.

```html
<label for="out-of-range-input">Out-of-range input</label>
<input
  type="number"
  id="out-of-range-input"
  min="1"
  max="10"
  value="12"
>
<span class="help-text">(value must be between 1 and 10)</span>
```

```css
input:out-of-range + .help-text::before {
  content: 'Out of range';
}
```

## :checked

![Checkbox inputs can be styled based on their checked or unchecked states. This allows custom checkboxes to alert the user when these inputs have been checked.](/img/checked.svg)

Most of you will be familiar with this selector. It gives us the ability to apply custom styles to checkboxes and radio buttons when checked. My technique for styling checkboxes involves creating a wrapper element and placing the `label` after the `input`.

I visually hide the input so that it disappears from view but is still clickable. Then I style `label::before` to look like the checkbox input and `label::after` to look like a checkmark. I use the `:checked` selector to style these two pseudo-elements appropriately:

```html
<div class="checkbox">
  <input type="checkbox"/>
  <label>Option</label>
</div>
```

```css
&:checked + label::before {
  background-color: var(--color-primary);
}

&:checked + label::after {
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0.2rem;
  left: 0.375rem;
  width: 0.25rem;
  height: 0.5rem;
  border: solid white;
  border-width: 0 2px 2px 0;
  transform: rotate(45deg);
  content: '';
}
```

## Getting a Head Start with the HiQ Framework

My new [CSS framework HiQ](https://jonathanharrell.github.io/hiq/) provides some useful base styling for HTML form inputs, including checkboxes, radio buttons, and disabled inputs.

HiQ is lightweight and is built with CSS variables that can be changed dynamically, especially useful for theme switching.
